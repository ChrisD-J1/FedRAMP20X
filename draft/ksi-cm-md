| KSI-CM-01    | Log and monitor system modifications                                             | All system changes are logged and monitored via centralized logging and monitoring tools.                    | Audit logs, change event records, monitoring alerts       | CM-6, CM-7                       |
| KSI-CM-02    | Execute changes through redeployment of version-controlled immutable resources   | Changes are applied by redeploying immutable, version-controlled resources rather than direct edits.         | Version control logs, deployment pipelines                | CM-10                            |
| KSI-CM-03    | Implement automated testing and validation of changes prior to deployment        | Automated CI/CD pipelines with testing validate changes before they are deployed to production.              | Test reports, CI/CD pipeline logs                         | CM-11                            |
| KSI-CM-04    | Have a documented change management procedure                                    | A formal, documented change management process governs how changes are requested, approved, and executed.    | Change management policy, change request records          | CM-6                             |
| KSI-CM-05    | Evaluate the risk and potential impact of any change                             | Risk assessment processes are applied to all changes to understand potential impacts before implementation.   | Risk assessment reports, change approval forms            | CM-7                             |
